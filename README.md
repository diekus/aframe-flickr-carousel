# A-Frame Flickr Carousel

A virtual reality web app demonstration, using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

It pulls a set of photos from Flickr dynamically and displays them in a circular carousel.

Click to advance to the next photo, or just look around with a WebVR-compatible headset on.

## Local development

You can use any web server to host the static files, for example `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. 
For help and alternatives, there is [a good, easy guide here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally#run-local-server). 

## If the carousel does not load...

Please update the Flickr API key in index.html.

To generate a new one, visit: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search.
